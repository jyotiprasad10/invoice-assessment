Hello All, I have completed the form as asked in the assessment,

To see the application working, you have to first login using the prefed credentials 

username - admin
password - password.

Once this is done, you will gain access to the Invoice Form, here on the right hand side you can input all the invoice credentials that are needed and on the lef hand side you can upload the invoiice using the upload button.

Formik has been used to take input in the React Form and store it using LocalStorage.

I have used

React for building the user interface.
Formik for managing forms and validation.
LocalStorage for data persistence.


 as asked in the assessment using JS.

 The credentials are stored in the localStorage and all the form details afre also stored, there is a ProtectedView component that helps us prevent access to the main form interface without being logged in which is very important.

 I have tried my best to incorporate the Figma Changes, there are some places that I would improve on if given time, but due to lack of time I could not work on them and i thought submitting in time is most important.

 To run the application you can clone the repo and use npm start.

 The app has been deployed using Netlify on the url - https://invoiceassessmentjyotiprasad.netlify.app/main.

 Also You can use the form bes in the resolution of 1800 X 2000. I have kept the resolution like this so that you can also access the localStorage in the Application tab using the Inspect buttton.

 I am adding som screenshots in the Description Section of the GitHub Repo for your ready reference. Do let me know what you think about the application and I would be very pleased to be given a chance to interview with your prestigious organisation.
